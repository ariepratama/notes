## New terms
* Contrastive learning (CL). 

## Premise
* We might not need graph augmentation.

## Problem
* Graph augmentation was proven to be necessary, but the authors argue that it was not the deciding factor. 

## Results
* They proof that the decisive factor for CL performance is the loss function. 
* Named their method to be **SimCGL**. 

## Future works
